# Heroku
Gishiki is tested costantly with Heroku because Heroku is fantastic and empowers
your application with a lot of simple tools without the overwork of maintaining
a server or a container!


## Getting Started
Setting up a perfectly working Heroku is super-easy:

   - Fork [this](https://github.com/NeroReflex/gishiki_startup) repository on GitHub
   - Register & Login to Heroku
   - Create a new application
   - Setup auto-deploy
   - Clone your new GitHub application to your local drive

Edit locally your application, commit and when a push is performet to GitHub your
Heroku application is automatically updated! Have fun <3.

## Database
Heroku provide database support as add-ons.

For example you can pick the "Heroku Postgres" add-on to have for free a PostgreSQL
database binded with your application!

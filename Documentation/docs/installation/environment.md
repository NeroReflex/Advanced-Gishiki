# Installation
Installing Gishiki is really simple, even a child could be able to do it:
however, in order to succeed you need to complete some steps.

You don't have to follow all the reported steps: you setup your environment,
your composer installation (local and/or remote) and presto!


## Windows
You may want to test Gishiki or develop your application on Windows:
to install the application on windows you should install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) and enable PDO drivers on php.ini. 


## Mac OS X
If you are willing to develop your application on a Mac system you should use
[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) too!


## Linux
Every production server runs on a linux or a container inside linux, this is why
every instruction you'll find are written for linux (Ubuntu 14.04/15.04 LTS).


## Virtual Machine
If you don't want to pollute your desktop environment you can use a virtualization
program, like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), to install [Ubuntu Server](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) and
follow the tutorial on that virtual machine!


## Let's go!
If you are a newcomer that doesn't like Heroku (or don't wanto to use it) 
I suggest you to follow the PHP 7.0 & nginx tutorial I have written for you.

If you want something that works in a few seconds Heroku is the right manual page!

# Configuration
Gishiki is a bit tricky to configure, but don't worry: you just need to edit
what you don't like as the [gishiki CLI](../cli/index.md) takes care of bootstrapping
a fully-working configuration.

the real configuration file is stored inside the application root directory and is called settings.json

It has a fixed (minimum) structure:
```json
{
    "general": {
        "autolog": "default"
    },
    "loggers": {
        "default": [
            {
                "class": "StreamHandler",
                "connection": [
                    "customLog.log",
                    400
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "connections": [
        {
            "name": "default",
            "query": "sqlite:\/\/default.sqlite"
        },
        {
            "name": "local",
            "query": "sqlite://relative/path/to/db.sqlite"
        },
        {
             "name": "debug",
             "query": "sqlite:///absolute/path/to/db.sqlite"
        }
    ]
}
```

As you might have thought those {{@VAR_NAMES}} are replaced with constants defined
in your environment AND/OR Heroku (or similar) "Config Variables"!

This is a *GREAT* feature that keeps *SECRET* your database connection descriptor and
your master server key while allowing application portability among illimitate environments!


## Automatic Logger
The automatic logger is automatically used to store log entries generated by exceptions.

To understand how to connect a logger it is important to read the [Logging](logging.md) chapter of this manual.

# Configuration
Every Gishiki [Application](application.md) need to be configured in order to properly work.

This is done by creating a json file called settings.json, you can use any other name but you'll also
need to pass that file name as a parameter o the Application constructor.

A settings file has a fixed (minimum) structure:
```json
{
    "logging": {
        "autolog": "default",
        "interfaces": {
            "default": [
                {
                    "class": "StreamHandler",
                    "connection": [
                        "customLog.log",
                        400
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "connections": [
        {
            "name": "default",
            "query": "sqlite:\/\/default.sqlite"
        },
        {
            "name": "local",
            "query": "sqlite://relative/path/to/db.sqlite"
        },
        {
             "name": "debug",
             "query": "sqlite:///absolute/path/to/db.sqlite"
        }
    ]
}
```

As you might have thought those {{@VAR_NAMES}} are replaced with constants defined
in your environment AND/OR Heroku (or similar) "Config Variables"!

This is a *GREAT* feature that keeps *SECRET* your database connection descriptor and
your master server key while allowing application portability among multiple environments!


## Automatic Logger
The automatic logger is automatically used to store log entries generated by exceptions.

To understand how to connect a logger it is important to read the [Logging](logging.md) chapter of this manual.

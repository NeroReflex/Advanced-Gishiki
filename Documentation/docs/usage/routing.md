# Routing
When a request arrives the framework must fulfill it.

The framework automatically maps a request to a resource located at "https://site.com/Home" into "/Home" (GET request).

The /Home string is the URI of the requested resource, the GET request is the HTTP method used to query that resource...
the question is.... 

How do I route that request to what I want to serve? The answer is: using the router!

The router is that fantastic component empowering your user-friendly URLs!


## Different methods
As for HTTP standards a client can perform a resource request using these verbs:
  
   -  GET identified as Route::GET
   -  POST  identified as Route::POST
   -  DELETE identified as Route::DELETE
   -  PUT identified as Route::PUT
   -  HEAD identified as Route::HEAD
   -  PATCH identified as Route::PATCH
   -  OPTIONS identified as Route::OPTIONS
   
When you set a routing rule (either static or dynamic) you have to select the 
verb that you want to be served in that route.

This is particulary handy when creating a RESTful service.


## Static Rules
Let's see how to create a custom route:

```php
use Gishiki\Core\Route;
use Gishiki\Logging\Logger;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Request;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Response;
use Gishiki\Algorithms\Collections\GenericCollection;

Route::get("/",
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //this is what will be executed when the client asks for "https://site.com/" (the homepage)
    
    //let's just forget about MVC pattern this time :)
    echo "Hello, World!";
});
```

To try this rule out you have to open rules.php and paste the provided code into 
it and direct your browser to: https://site.com/ .


## Dynamic Rules
This route is really simple: just an URI check... but you are creating a dynamic application, 
and URIs cannot be static URIs every time, in fact sooner or later you will need to capture a parameter passed 
as a parameter with the URL.

Let's just consider this simple example:
```php
use Gishiki\Core\Route;
use Gishiki\Logging\Logger;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Request;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Response;
use Gishiki\Algorithms\Collections\GenericCollection;

Route::get("/Hello/{name_surname}",
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //this is what will be executed when the client asks for "https://site.com/User/urName+urSurname"
    
    //nice to meet you!
    $response->write("Hello, ".$params->{"name_surname"}."!");
});

Route::get("/Home/{name}",
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //this is what will be executed when the client asks for "https://site.com/Home/some_name"
    
    //nice to meet you!
    $response->write("Hello, ".$params->name."!");
});
```

You already know what you are going to do, right? :D

https://site.com/Home/your_name and you will see "Hello, your_name!" nothing complex here, right?

## Custom Dynamic Rules
You might want to catch something more specific than just "everything but '/'",
say for example an integer or an email address:

```php
use Gishiki\Core\Route;
use Gishiki\Logging\Logger;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Request;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Response;
use Gishiki\Algorithms\Collections\GenericCollection;

Route::get("/Hello/{user_email:email}",
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //this is what will be executed when the client asks for "https://site.com/Hello/yourEmail%40address.com"
    
    //send that mail!
    if (!mail($arguments->user_email , "Gishiki RESTful test" , "Welcome to my RESTful test service <3")) {
        $default_logger = new Logger();
        $default_logger->warning("An e-mail is missing :(");
    }
});
```

That's great isn't it? Actually what you can catch is:
    
   -  'default' a generic string
   -  'email' an email address
   -  'integer' an integer number


## All request methods
Sometimes you may need to register a route that responds to all HTTP verbs, you 
are allowed to do that by using 'any':

```php
use Gishiki\Core\Route;
use Gishiki\Logging\Logger;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Request;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Response;
use Gishiki\Algorithms\Collections\GenericCollection;

Route::any("/",
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //do something general with your homepage!
});
```

the action is taken if that URI is hit, regardless of the method the client used 
to perform the request.


## Two or more request methods
An interesting feature of the router is how you create a route for two or more
request methods:

```php
use Gishiki\Core\Route;
use Gishiki\Logging\Logger;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Request;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Response;
use Gishiki\Algorithms\Collections\GenericCollection;

Route::match([Route::GET, Route::POST], "/",
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //you want your homepage to be reached only with get and post
});
```

the action is taken if that URI is hit only when using get or post request method. 


## Error catching
You know, things doesn't always go as you want: it is necessary to think about 
unexpected circumstances. You do it by setting an error callback, 
which is nothing more than a bit special routing rule:

```php
use Gishiki\Core\Route;
use Gishiki\Logging\Logger;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Request;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Response;
use Gishiki\Algorithms\Collections\GenericCollection;

Route::any(Route::NOT_FOUND,
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //this is what will be executed when the client asks for an unrouted URI
    
    //error message!
    $response->write("Sorry man, you are asking for something I can't give you :(");
});
```

As you can see an error routing rule (or error callback) is exactly any other URI
and follows the same exact rules, however for known errors the HTTP status code is
automatically changed (for example if a Route::NOT_FOUND URI is catched 404 Not Found
is added automatically to the response).

You cannot change this behaviour, but you can change the status code:

```php
use Gishiki\Core\Route;
use Gishiki\Logging\Logger;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Request;
use Gishiki\HttpKernel\Response;
use Gishiki\Algorithms\Collections\GenericCollection;

Route::any(Route::NOT_FOUND,
    function (Request $request, Response &$response, GenericCollection &$arguments)
{
    //this is what will be executed when the client asks for an unrouted URI
    $response->withStatus(500);

    //error message!
    $response->write("Sorry man, you are asking for something I can't give you :(");
});
```

A bit stange to send to the client a 500 Internal Server Error for a missing
resource, but nothing stops you from doing that.


## Limitation
You cannot route URIs that start with /api/ or /service/ because they are reserved for web services (explained in a different chapter).

You cannot match something that has a slash '/' character using a dynamic placeholder: {name} cannot capture something like "mario/rossi".


## Conclusions
The router is the fastest and easiest component within Gishiki, 
because it is the first component that is used and the only one you __REALLY HAVE TO__ use.

This means that you are now good to go... Everything you *MUST* know in order to use Gishiki ends here.

Everything else is a plus you may need to accelerate the development of your projects,
although you should really learn how to deal with the [Request](request.md) and the [Response](response.md) objects passed to you.

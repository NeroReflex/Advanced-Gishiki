_*Gishiki*_: a modern and elegant MVC framework for PHP >= 5.4 and HHVM.

Gishiki means 'ritual' in japanese, this name was chosen because this framework will help you to perform the
ritual of creation and deployment of web digital contents.

Due to its design this framework won't force you to use its features: you are completely free to use it as you wish to,
even if that breaks up MVC principles and/or uses a custom ORM.

Gishiki is so fast to deploy that you don't even need to configure it to get started!

What are you waiting for?
Installing is as simple as cloning the repository and in 2 minutes you are up in experimenting its features!


## Documentation
A simple tutorial is inside the Documentation folder. That tutorial is meant to be compiled using mkdocs.

You can browse [here](http://neroreflex.github.io/Gishiki) the online updated version.

The online version matches the development branch.


## Services
Gishiki focuses on high-performance cloud computing in an MVC-oriented paradigm.

Any cloud application is composite of services.

Gishiki lets you easily create every service you need and helps you interacting with yours own services from wherever you want.

Moreover, a service can be used extremely easily in any environment, may it be 
an Android/iOS application, another service, a Desktop program or another website.


## Websites
Gishiki deploy an MVC pattern that is a bit special to help you building any digital servie you want with just one framework.

In order to help you achieving your goals Gishiki provides helpers to help you with most common operations,
but let you free of doing things the way you want.


## Heroku Compatibility
Gishiki aims for total Heroku compatibility because you can deploy you fantastic
website or app in a few seconds forgetting about maintaining the server!


## RESTful services
Thanks to the really fast router you can deploy a RESTful service in a minute or two...

The HTTP router is written from scratch to be as fast as possible!


## Security
The security is never enough, especially when dealing with people's data in a digital environment!

To help you obtaining a secure working environment Gishiki deploy a set of cryptographic utilities
based on the OpenSSL ones and abstract away most common cryptographic operations.


## Description
This framework was written with speed, security and simplicity in mind!
Gishiki helps you creating in a very short amount of time web services and web applications which are both: maintainable and expandable.

With Gishiki you can create any digital service that your new business activity may need,
without permanently binding yourself to a single technology, program or 3rd party service.
This is achieved by giving you the option of changing a service just by editing a configuration file.


## Database
Gishiki uses an OHM to help you interacting with your own databases.

Yes, that is not a misspell: Gishiki uses an OHM, not an ORM! OHM stands for "Object-hybrid mapper"!
This OHM has been designed and written from scratch to be perfectly integrated within Gishiki!

The OHM is designed to be as fast as possible, and maintain compatibility over differents
database managers!

Gishiki is designed to provide an invisible abstraction layer over these database managers:

   - SQLite
   - MySQL and derivates
   - Oracle
   - PostgreSQL
   - Microsoft SQL Server / Azure
   - firebase
   - MongoDB
   - Cassandra


## Caching
Gishiki achieve better performance using its own cache engine where possible in order
to increase your application performance!


## Logging
Gishiki gives you the ability of logging what happens on your server.

Gishiki automatically logs exceptions, but delivers you full-control over your logs,
exposing a simple logging API.

Gishiki uses UNIX syslog for all of its logging management, allowing you to do
whatever you want with your log entries.

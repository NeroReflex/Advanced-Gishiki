_*Gishiki*_: a modern and elegant MVC framework for PHP >= 5.5 and HHVM.

Gishiki means 'ritual' in japanese, this name was chosen because this framework
will help you to perform the ritual of creation and deployment of web digital contents.

Due to its design this framework won't force you to use its features:
you are completely free to use it as you wish to,
even if that breaks up MVC principles!

What are you waiting for?
Installing is as simple as cloning the repository and in 2 minutes you are up in
experimenting its features!


## PaaS Compatibility

Gishiki aims for total [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) compatibility because you can deploy
your fantastic website or app in a few seconds forgetting about maintaining
the server!

Alongside Heroku, Gishiki aims for the maximum compatibility with any *PaaS* (Platform as a Service)
and Docker.


## Documentation

A simple tutorial is inside the Documentation folder.
That tutorial is meant to be compiled using mkdocs.

You can browse [here](http://neroreflex.github.io/Gishiki) the online 
version matching the master branch.


## Services

Gishiki focuses on high-performance cloud computing in an MVC-oriented paradigm.

Any cloud application is composite of services.

Gishiki lets you easily create every service you need and helps you interacting
with yours own services from wherever you want.

Moreover, a service can be used extremely easily in any environment, may it be 
an Android/iOS application, another service, a Desktop program or another website.


## Websites

Gishiki deploy an MVC pattern that is a bit special to help you building any digital servie you want with just one framework.

In order to help you achieving your goals Gishiki provides helpers to help you with most common operations,
but let you free of doing things the way you want.


## RESTful services

Thanks to the really fast router you can deploy a RESTful service in a minute or two...

The HTTP router is written from scratch to be as fast as possible!


## Security

Security is never enough, especially when dealing with people's data in a
digital environment!

To help you obtaining a secure working environment Gishiki deploy a set of
cryptographic utilities based on the OpenSSL ones and abstract away most
common cryptographic operations.


## Description

This framework was written with speed, security and simplicity in mind!
Gishiki helps you creating in a very short amount of time web services and web applications which are both: maintainable and expandable.

With Gishiki you can create any digital service that your new business activity may need,
without permanently binding yourself to a single technology, program or 3rd party service.
This is achieved by giving you the option of changing a service just by editing a configuration file.


## Logging

Gishiki gives you the ability of logging what happens on your server.

Gishiki automatically logs exceptions, but delivers you full-control over your logs,
exposing a simple logging API.


## Requirements

Everything you need is php >= 5.5 and composer!

Gishiki runs better while using a dedicated http webserver, but you can use the
one bundled with PHP!

*v2.0.0-alpha* => *v2.0.0*
- Better Code
- Fixed almost every bug preventing the framework to work (I'm sorry)
- Everything is instantiated and the entire lifecycle is contained within an Application object => I can now perform a full framework test
- A Controller has a reference to each database and logging connections
- Every unhandled exception is now logged, not only Gishiki own exceptions
- Completed the Router class
